As I mentioned on the phone the coding challenge directions are listed below. 
After you finish, please include everything in a zip file and send it back to me by 
end of day next Tuesday, 9/26 (or sooner if possible). On average it should take around 
4-6 hours to complete. 

It will test your HTML/CSS skills, as well as Javascript, and comes in two parts.

1. Please create a webpage that lists the publications/magazines in which Eargo 
has been featured before. Please use Javascript (jQuery or any other framework you 
are comfortable with) to fetch metadata about the below publications from Wikipedia. 
You may want to use wikipedia REST api. Here is the reference: 
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page. For example, I would use 
jQuery and $.ajax for this. You might end up parsing the returned data from 
wikipedia API to fetch necessary values.

Each of the publications has a page on Wikipedia, for example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gizmodo. If you look at the right side of the wikipedia page, you will see a box with key information about the publication, such as editor's name, year of launch, logo)
The finished page should look similar to the following mock-up (Eargo-pubs.jpg). The logo placement alternates between left and right side. The publication data should never be hardcoded, you need to dynamically fetch it via the api.

How you want to style it is up to you. Feel free to use Eargo logo for the top header.

The publications are:
Popular Science
PC Magazine
Techcrunch
Gizmodo
The Verge
GeekWire

The data that we would like to see in the list is:
1. Logo of the publication
2. Name of the publication
3. Type of Site (where applicable, for online publications)
4. Editor
5. Owner (where applicable), Publisher, if owner is not available
6. Website URL
7. Year Founded / Year launched / First Issue (just pick one of these)
8. Created By (where applicable)







2. Please create a separate webpage that looks like the screenshot in the attachment (Eargo-shop.png).
- The contents need to be centered horizontally (the white vertical strip on left side should have the same width as the one on the right side)
- Page needs to be responsive. For smaller screens, you may want to have product image/carousel stacked on top of the ordering form.

Let me know if you have any questions or would like me to clarify anything.
